# MER Opportunity Hematite Analysis

This project aims to catalog and analyze images of hematite concretions ("blueberries") from the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, focusing on the Meridiani Planum region. The goal is to create a reproducible workflow for studying the geological context and distribution of these features as indicators of past water activity on Mars.
